Squeeze is a python project, the program take different words in parameters and make an exhaustive wordlist with different possibilities of mixing (switch the word's place, put some Upper letters, put some numbers etc...). It's like crunch but it actually don't switch letters but words. The purpuse was obviously wordlist for password cracking ^^

If you have some questions just ask ^^

FEY.
