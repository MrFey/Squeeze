Squeeze is a python project, the program takes different words in argument and make an exhaustive wordlist with a lot possibilities of mixing (switch the word's place, put some Upper letters, put some numbers etc...). It's like crunch but it actually don't switch letters but words. The purpuse is obviously wordlisting for password cracking ^^

If you have any questions just ask ^^


Project been merged with https://github.com/t3l3machus/psudohash to add more common derivation
